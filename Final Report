Research Question
For this report we have decided to use the following research question: 
“How could a book with a lot of bad attention, like Fifty Shades of grey, become a bestseller?”.

To answer this question we came up with the following sub questions:
Is the overall opinion of the book indeed negative or is this just an assumption made?
What is the general motivation of the negative/positive reviews?
What is the motivation for people to start reading this book? 

Approach
In finding an answer to the first sub question, we wanted to look at three things. 
First of all, we had a look at the proportion of positive and negative votes using unix scripts (number 1). 
Secondly, we looked at the usefulness of the reviews, also with unix scripts (numbers 2 & 3). 
With these results we wanted to check the findings of the distribution of the reviews. 
Besides that, we wanted to know whether we could speak of an instant negative hype or not. 
For this we used unix commands (numbers 4,5 & 6) and looked at the ratings just after publishment. 
With the answers to these questions we could form a general idea about the overall opinion of the book.
To find out what the general motivation of people is to either like or dislike the book, we divided all the reviews in two parts using unix scripts (numbers 7 & 8). 
Now we have one file with all the ratings lower than 3, a second file with all the ratings higher than 3. 
By counting the words in both groups of reviews with a unix script (number 9), some frequently reoccuring words could be identified per file. 
We also visualized these words in a wordcloud, using the tool http://tagcrowd.com/. 
Next, we have created a word tree, using the tool https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/?source=5ede12648b2941c476779cb549d4704d for the positive wordcloud and https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/?source=5943308abfde281c4d31a56bc9bc3861 for the negative wordcloud. 
These tools helped us to close read on the words that were most frequent in both files, since these tools showed us the most frequent word combinations made with these words. 
Now we had a good idea of what people were actually saying about the book. 
For the question why people actually started reading this book, we will look at the contexts of motivational sentences like “i started reading this book…” or “... decided to read …”. 
We will look for these sentences/words and their surrounding words using unix commands (numbers 10-15). 
By reading these motivations and their surrounding words we got some insight in the general motivation of people to read this book. 
This gave us new search terms to look for using unix commands (numbers 16-21). 
With these results we got a better insight in the general motivation of people to read this book. 
With all of this information combined we could eventually formulate a conclusion to our main question. 


Analysis and interpretation of our results. 
Is the overall opinion of the book indeed negative or is this just an assumption made?
First we wanted to find out whether the overall opinion about the book was really negative or whether this was just an assumption most people made. 
With the results from script 1 we could conclude that most people rate the book a 1.0 and therefore we could assume that the overall opinion about the book is really negative. 
See figure 1 for the overall rating behaviour.
By looking at the usefulness of the reviews we got the following results, using script number 3. 
      1.0     1013
      1.0     1239
      1.0     15906
      1.0     1698
      1.0     208
      1.0     213
      1.0     219
      1.0     280
      1.0     290
      1.0     311
      1.0     317
      1.0     3211
      1.0     336
      1.0     4265
      1.0     441
      1.0     446
      1.0     490
      1.0     503
      1.0     574
      1.0     6083
      1.0     653
      1.0     720
      1.0     789
      1.0     930
      1.0     969
      2.0     23311
      3.0     10755
      3.0     1550
      4.0     707
      5.0     323
From this list we could conclude that the reviews with a 4.0 and a 5.0 rating are not considered to be that useful. 
12 305 people thought a review with a rating of 3.0 was a useful review, which would be the people with a neutral opinion about the book. 
23.311 people voted a review with a rating of 2.0 as a useful review and 42.104 people voted a review with a rating of 1.0 as a useful review. 
This shows us that most of the votes for a useful review are given to reviews with a rating of 1.0 and 2.0. 
This confirms our findings to the above question. 
The review which got the most votes as a useful review is a review with a rating of 2.0, after that a review with a 1.0 got the most votes, and third in line is a review with a 3.0 rating. 
This information also confirms the findings above. 
Besides that, we found out, using scripts 4,5 and 6, that in the first months after publishment of the book already more negative reviews were given than positive reviews (see figure 2). 
Vintage Books acquired the publishing rights of the book in march 2012. The ratings that were given in this month are:
      103   2012-03     1.0
      36    2012-03     2.0
      13    2012-03     3.0
      2     2012-03     4.0
      3     2012-03     5.0
In the following months the book was given the following ratings:
      417     2012-04     1.0
      108     2012-04     2.0
      50      2012-04     3.0
      60      2012-04     4.0
      233     2012-04     5.0
      794     2012-05     1.0
      210     2012-05     2.0
      104     2012-05     3.0
      122     2012-05     4.0
      451     2012-05     5.0
      768     2012-06     1.0
      194     2012-06     2.0
      91     2012-06     3.0
      78     2012-06     4.0
      393     2012-06     5.0
      795     2012-07     1.0
      183     2012-07     2.0
      64     2012-07     3.0
      51     2012-07     4.0
      221     2012-07     5.0
From this list we can conclude that in the following months the book got more positive reviews. 
So in these months there are people who thought the book had something good in it. 
However, the negative rating of a 1.0 remains the rating that is given the most. 
Therefore, we could not say that the book has been more popular shortly after release. 
When using script number 6 we found out that most reviews were written in May, June and July 2012. 
Looking at these results we can therefore conclude there has been an instant negative hype about the book.
